/* This is where you write your CSS!
CSS is how you style your website, such as 
setting colours, changing height and widhts of things and beyond!
The project also includes Bootstrap's CSS so you can 
use that without tryping it in here */

/* This is some example of custom CSS. It adds a black line under the carousel */

.carousel{
     margin-bottom: 2em;
